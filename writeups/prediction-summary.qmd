### Abstract

Provide a 3-5 sentence summary of your work on the primary task. Indicate what input data was used, what method was used for binary class predictions, what method was used for multiclass predictions, and what estimated accuracies were achieved.

> *Header and paragraph content was scraped from the raw webpages and processed into term frequencies of word tokens. For binary classification, a two-layer neural network yielded an estimated 81.4% accuracy; for multiclass classification, a support vector machine gave 78% accuracy.*

> *A logistic regression with a slightly modified architecture was developed as well for binary classification. Similar preprocessing techniques were used. The final test accuracy was 80.74% using the metric of weighted F1 score.*

### Preprocessing

In one paragraph lay out your preprocessing pipeline. No need to provide exact step-by-step detail; just give an overview of the main components:

For the principle logistic regression with modified architecture,
-   The `parse_data()` function from `preprocessing.R` is used in addition to the customized function to capture the headers and paragraphs information from the raw HTML.

-   All punctuation words and stopped words were removed. Every letters were converted to lower case. Additionally, tokenization and lemmatization were conducted using `Spacy` package. 

-   Different numbers of pronouns were counted and treated as additional features for training the model. Term Frequency-Inverse Term Frequency (tf-idf) vectorization was performed to weight the tokenized unigrams and bigrams. Logit-odds from unigrams after PCA were also treated as one of the numerical features.

-   what text content was extracted from HTML

-   how text was cleaned

-   how cleaned text was represented quantitatively


### Methods

Describe your final predictive models. Include one paragraph with details on the binary classification approach, and one on the multiclass approach. Include for each:

-   what ML/statistical method was used

-   model specification and hyperparameter selection

-   training method

For the principle logistic regression with modified architecture, 


### Results

Indicate the predictive accuracy of the binary classifications and the multiclass classifications. Provide a table for each, and report sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.[^1]
