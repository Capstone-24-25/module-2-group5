### Abstract

Provide a 3-5 sentence summary of your work on the primary task. Indicate what input data was used, what method was used for binary class predictions, what method was used for multiclass predictions, and what estimated accuracies were achieved.

> *Header and paragraph content was scraped from the raw webpages and processed into term frequencies of word tokens. For binary classification, a two-layer neural network yielded an estimated 81.4% accuracy; for multiclass classification, a support vector machine gave 78% accuracy.*

> *A logistic regression with a slightly modified architecture was developed as well for binary classification. Similar preprocessing techniques were used. The final test accuracy was 80.74% using the metric of weighted F1 score.*

In this project, we developed predictive models for binary and multiclass classification of webpage claims using transformer-based architectures. The input data consisted of cleaned textual content extracted from raw HTML, with preprocessing steps including HTML parsing and tokenization. For binary classification, we fine-tuned a BERT-based transformer model, achieving an accuracy of 82%. Similarly, for multiclass classification, we used a BERT-based model tailored for five classes, achieving an accuracy of 84.57%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer models in handling complex textual data for both binary and multiclass prediction tasks.

### Preprocessing

In one paragraph lay out your preprocessing pipeline. No need to provide exact step-by-step detail; just give an overview of the main components:

For the principle logistic regression with modified architecture,
-   The `parse_data()` function from `preprocessing.R` is used in addition to the customized function to capture the headers and paragraphs information from the raw HTML.

-   All punctuation words and stopped words were removed. Every letters were converted to lower case. Additionally, tokenization and lemmatization were conducted using `Spacy` package. 

-   Different numbers of pronouns were counted and treated as additional features for training the model. Term Frequency-Inverse Term Frequency (tf-idf) vectorization was performed to weight the tokenized unigrams and bigrams. Logit-odds from unigrams after PCA were also treated as one of the numerical features.

-   what text content was extracted from HTML

-   how text was cleaned

-   how cleaned text was represented quantitatively


### Methods

Describe your final predictive models. Include one paragraph with details on the binary classification approach, and one on the multiclass approach. Include for each:

For the principal logistic regression with a modified architecture, two logistic principal component regression models with L1 penalty were performed on unigrams and bigrams vectorized data, respectively. Grid search with 5-fold cross-validation was used to determine the optimal regularization parameter and exclude features with lower importance based on their contributions to the covariance matrix. The final principle features were combined with logit-odds from unigrams and numbers of pronouns to form a final `X_features`.

### Results

Indicate the predictive accuracy of the binary classifications and the multiclass classifications. Provide a table for each, and report sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.[^1]
